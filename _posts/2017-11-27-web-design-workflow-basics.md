Your need to build a landing page, or the user interface for a web app from scratch, what do you do?


As bright eyed and optimistic developers, it can be tempting to jump straight into designing your websites using HTML & CSS. But it's a trap!

I've been there, and it usually doesn't end very well. There are too many things to consider when building a page - the images, the font, colors, size, buttons, flow, feel, etc. Whats worse is trying to trial and error all these factors with HTML and CSS - not the best idea imo.

It is therefore, in our best interest to minimize factors that could result in front-end burnout; this is when a design workflow comes into place.

It allows you to focus your attention on the right things, at the right time.

## **Web Design Workflow**
A typical web design workflow is broken down into 4 parts.
+ Planning
+ Design
+ Development
+ Launch

### **Planning**
+ Goal: Gather requirements - determine what are the requirements for the page, just list them all out, determine the goals of the page, the target audience, and come up with detailed feature requirements.
+ Things to watch out for:
  - Page has many goals - having many goals pulls the user in many different directions, which may cause subpar results
  - Too big a target audience - if you make a page for everybody, you're really making it for nobody - your page should speak clearly to a well defined persona that you determine.

### **Design**
- Wireframe - Come up with a basic wireframe for your page, the reason for a wireframe is that it allows you to view your page from a big picture perspective, do the sections flow? Start with big section chunks, then go into the section blocks, then into the details.
- Hi-fidelity Mockups - having a hi-fidelity mock up will enable you to visualize a more precise illustration of your page.
- Collect Assets
- Softwares to use
