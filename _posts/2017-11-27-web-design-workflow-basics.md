Your need to build a landing page, or the user interface for a web app from scratch, what do you do?


As bright eyed and optimistic developers, it can be tempting to jump straight into designing your websites using HTML & CSS. 

Beware, it's a trap!

There are simply too many things to consider when building a page - the images, the font, colors, size, buttons, flow, feel, etc. 
Whats makes it worse is that you'll continually trial and error all these factors with HTML and CSS - which can be fatiguing.

It is therefore, in our best interest to minimize factors that could result in front-end burnout; this is when a design workflow comes into place.

By having a process framework, you can focus your attention on the right things, at the right time.

# **A Web Design Workflow**
A typical web design workflow is broken down into 4 parts.
+ Planning
+ Design
+ Development
+ Launch
>

## **Planning**
The goal of planning is to **lay the underlying intent for the page** you're designing.
>
  **Action:**
  + Gather requirements: 
    Determine what are the requirements for the page, list out what you want the page to accomplish, determine the goals of the page, who is the target audience that will be using the page?
  + Things to watch out for:
    - Pages that do too many things, for too many people, if you make a page for everybody, you'll end up making it for nobody - your page should speak clearly to a well defined character that you determine.
>

## **Design**
After planning, it's time to  **start designing** (do not code anything yet). At this point, your goal is to build the page flow using wireframes, then conceptualizing it using a hi-fidelity mock-up. Think of this step as creating a blueprint for your page.
>
  **Actions:**
  1. Wireframing:
  + Come up with a basic wireframe for your page, a wireframe gives you the ability to view your page from a big picture perspective.
  2. Hi-fidelity Mockups: 
  + Upon completing your wireframe, you may opt to build a hi-fidelity mockup, a hi-fi mockup allows you to visualize more precisely how the page looks.
  3. Review:
  + Depending on which you've built (a wireframe or a hi-fi mockup), you'll want to review it by asking a few key questions:
    - Does this design meet the requirements for the page?
    - Do the compotents flow together?
    - Are there any unnecessary components?
    At this point, once you're satisfied, you can present it to your team for feedback.
  4. Collect Assets

## **Development**
Once you've gotten your design blueprint. It's time to **start coding** the site. At this point, your design is fixed and you've got a good gameplan, therefore you may focus fully on coding.

>
  **Actions:**
  1. HTML Sections:
  + Come up with the bare bones structure of your HTML page.
  + Fill in copy
  + Add images, fonts, assets required
  2. Write CSS: 
  + Depending on how you organize your CSS (SMACSS, OOCSS, BEM, etc) you'll want to have a systemized way of writing your css.
  3. Write Javascript:
  + Some designers write the Javascript before any styling, and some after. IMO this is up to personal preference, choose whichever makes more sense to your work.
  4. Test and verify functionality
  + Once you're done, verify that the page is working as intended, this means checking for mobile responsiveness (phone & tablets), checking URLs, re-read copy for typos.

### **Launch**
You've completed the page, it's time to launch the page!

>
  **Actions:**
  1. Final polish
  2. Push to live
  3. Test live using BrowserStack
